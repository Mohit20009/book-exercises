# Exercise 5: dplyr grouped operations

# Install the `"nycflights13"` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`
#install.packages("nycflights13")  # should be done already
library("nycflights13")
library("dplyr")

# What was the average departure delay in each month?
# Save this as a data frame `dep_delay_by_month`
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarizing your data
dep_delay_by_month <- flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T))
View(dep_delay_by_month)

# Which month had the greatest average departure delay?
dep_delay_by_month %>% 
  filter(avg_delay== max(avg_delay)) %>% 
  select(month) %>% 
  pull(month)

# If your above data frame contains just two columns (e.g., "month", and "delay"
# in that order), you can create a scatterplot by passing that data frame to the
# `plot()` function
dep_delay_by_month %>% 
  plot()

# To which destinations were the average arrival delays the highest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarize your data
# You can use the `head()` function to view just the first few rows
