## This is my report!

I like writing reports 

This is the code we will look at in class. Thisis just plain old Markdown that lets you rendertext in **bold** or _italics_. However, you canput in a block of R code, and the document willshow the code and the results!
```{r example, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
numbers <- runif(1:100)  # make random numbers
hist(numbers)  # show histogram of the numbers
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers)

img_url <- "![puppies](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yoXdn.png)"

letters <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
numbers <- 1:4
df <- data.frame(letters = letters, numbers = numbers)
kable(df)
```

The mean of the numbers happens to be **`r numbers_mean`**.
```{r other_cunk}
print(numbers)

```
